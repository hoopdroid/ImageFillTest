# Visualization of Image Filling Algorithms

This project provides an interactive visualization of various image filling algorithms. 

## Overview

Upon clicking the "Generate" button, the user interface will display two identical images. For each image, a filling algorithm can be separately selected using spinners.

Once an area on any image is tapped, the corresponding closed regions will start to gradually fill in step-by-step according to the selected algorithm. The pace of this animation, or the frame rate, can be adjusted using the "Speed" slider.

## Features

- Generate two identical images to compare different filling algorithms.
- Select filling algorithms for each image via spinners.
- Interactively tap any region in the images to start the filling process.
- Adjust the animation speed (frame rate) with a slider control.

## User Guide

1. Press the "Generate" button to display two identical images on the screen.
2. For each image, select the desired filling algorithm from the dropdown menu in the spinner.
3. Tap on any region in an image to start the fill process.
4. The closed area will gradually start to fill, visualizing the steps of the algorithm.
5. Adjust the animation speed or frame rate using the "Speed" slider.
